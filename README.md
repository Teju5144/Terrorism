Exploratory data analysis-terrorism
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in the data analysis process that aims to understand the characteristics of a dataset before applying any formal statistical techniques. Through EDA, data scientists delve into the raw data, uncovering patterns, relationships, and outliers, while also assessing the quality and integrity of the information.
I did project under GRIP JUNE 23.
